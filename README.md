# CurrencyApp

Currency Application which uses 2 way data binding, automatically converts one currency to another. It also provides a feature that sums 2 or more currencies and gives the value in the chosen currency. [this app uses FastForex API, the key that I use is valid just for a month or so... so If currency tables aren't working properly, that ain't my fault lol].


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.3.
